# Interoperability Testing Results

This directory (and associated subdirectories) contains up-to-date information about any testing results (good or bad) that have been encountered thus far.

These pages can be consulted to determine if the end-user may run into problems with particular products or packages.

## Vendors

Vendors are encouraged to check their products and champion fixing any areas that need updating. Often these fixes amount to updating to the latest version of any imported open-source package and/or applying a few small diffs.

## Interoperability Template

Submitters should make use of the [Template](INTEROP-TEMPLATE.md) for adding new testing results via a GitHub PR. Additional testing criteria may be added at a future date.
