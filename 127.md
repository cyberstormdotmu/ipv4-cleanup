# Reducing 127.0.0.0/8

Traditionally this address range has been used for "local to the host"
communication, however in surveying the state of this part of the IPv4
 universe, only a few
IP addresses in this range are used - some for spam protection daemons,
some for DNS.

We propose cutting down the "localnet space" to 127.0.0.0/16 (e.g. 127.0.0.0-
127.0.255.255) and allowing the remaining 127.1-255/16s to appear on the
wire.
