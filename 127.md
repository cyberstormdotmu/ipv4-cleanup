# 127.0.0.0/8

Traditionally this address range has been used for "local to the host"
communication, however in surveying the state of the universe, only a few
IP addresses are used

We propose cutting down the "local space" to 127.0.0.0/16 (e.g. 127.0.0.0-
127.0.255.255) and allowing 

and even to some extent smarter ones, don't care what appears on the
wire.
