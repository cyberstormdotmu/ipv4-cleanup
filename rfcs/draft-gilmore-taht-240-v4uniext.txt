                    The IPv4 240/4 Unicast Extension
                   draft-gilmore-taht-240-v4uniext-01

Abstract

   The set of unicast addresses is the largest and most useful block of
   addresses in the Internet Protocol (IP).  Some portions of the IP
   address space have been "reserved for future use" for decades.  The
   future has arrived.

   This memo reclassifies the address block 240.0.0.0/4 as globally
   routable unicast address space.  Most implementations have already
   treated it as such for a decade, and the remainder can and will be
   extended to do so.

2.  History

   The Internet Protocol version 4 addressing model started off simple
   and has evolved over 40 years.  This Internet-Draft briefly
   summarizes that evolution, and proposes that as IPv4 approaches the
   end of its design life, significant benefits to the Internet
   community can ensue from simplifying a few of the vestigial choices
   made during that evolution.

   The Internet Protocol (IP version 4, IPv4) was designed from scratch
   as a replacement for the ARPAnet protocols.  Rather than enforcing
   uniformity, it followed the "Catenet Model" of a concatenated network
   of diversely implemented underlying networks, connected by simple and
   relatively memoryless gateways. @IEN48 By the year 1981, IPv4 had
   landed as a simple and well-edited specification.  [RFC0791]

   The designers improved on ARPAnet's 16-bit address space with IPv4's
   32-bit address space.  The 32-bit address space was clearly chosen as
   a compromise; its inability to address all the nodes that would
   likely want to use it was known from the start, but resource
   limitations in early routers discouraged the use of longer addresses.
   [RFC0760]  FIXME, we still don't have a good ref for this assertion.

   The initial IP design designated almost 7/8ths of the possible
   addresses as Unicast addresses.  These addresses identified
   individual nodes and routers, and could be used as source and
   destination addresses of packets designed to be forwarded with full
   global reachability, and/or for packets on local area networks.
   [RFC0791][RFC0796]  (The term "unicast" only came into use when
   multicast was invented for the Internet protocol in 1985.  Initially
   ALL the existing non-reserved IP addresses were, by default, unicast
   addresses.  [RFC0966]

   1/8th of the 32-bit address space was left as "reserved for future
   use", and a few other 256ths were reserved for simple protocol
   functions or for future use.  [RFC0791](#3.2) [RFC0796]

   By 1984, subnets were made part of the IP protocol.  [RFC0917],
   [RFC0922]

   Initially, subnets were only used "locally".  The global Internet
   routing infrastructure still only knew how to route to Class A, B,
   and C networks.  Local equipment in each such network could route
   locally to any local subnets, such as multiple Ethernets on a
   university campus.

   Also in 1984, broadcast addresses were added to IPv4.  [RFC0919],
   [RFC0922] This required reserving one IPv4 address within each and

   every network or subnet (the final address in that network or subnet,
   the "all-ones" host address).  The address 255.255.255.255 was also
   reserved to make it easier to broadcast on "a local hardware network"
   without knowing the details of those networks.  This made broadcast a
   useful mechanism for discovering a node's own address on the network.

   The 1984 broadcast extension also reserved the initial (zero) address
   in each network or subnet, with [RFC0919] stating that "There is
   probably no reason for such addresses to appear anywhere", with a
   now-obsolete exception.  It also, apparently by coincidence,
   documented a human writing convention of designating a "network
   number" with the zero address, such as 36.0.0.0.  This convention has
   confused subsequent protocol users into thinking that the initial
   (zero) address in a network or subnet cannot be used as an ordinary
   unicast node address.

   During that era, there was confusion in one popular IPv4
   implementation, 4.2 BSD, which used the zero node address for
   broadcast, rather than the all-ones node address.  When these
   mismatched implementations tried to interoperate on an Ethernet, it
   was easy to produce "broadcast storms" that would uselessly consume
   all available network bandwidth until manually stopped.  The
   offending implementation was upgraded in the subsequent 4.3 BSD
   release to meet the standards.  The problem has not recurred for
   decades, but a remnant of the gaffe exists in the prohibition on
   using the zero node address in a network or subnet.  [RFC1122]
   (section FIXME)

   Later (1988) designers chose to allocate 1/16th of the total space
   (half of the formerly reserved space) for multicast use.  [RFC1054]
   While multicast was a much better idea than the sole similar former
   option (broadcast), its use on anything besides local area networks
   has remained a tiny niche, in retrospect clearly not worth
   designating 1/16th of the entire address space for.  This address
   space is called 224/4 in Phil Karn's more modern CIDR [RFC4632]
   notation.

   By 1989, the revisions to the basic Internet Protocol suite required
   reading dozens and dozens of documents.  The basic requirements for
   Internet hosts and gateways were then consolidated into
   [RFC1022][RFC1023][RFC1024].

   By 1992, the original network addressing and routing architecture was
   straining at the seams.  The problems were "the lack of a network
   class of a size which is appropriate for mid-sized organization[s]",
   growth of routing tables beyond available capacities, and the
   "eventual exhaustion of the 32-bit IP address space" as documented in
   [RFC1338].  The proposed fix involved an extension of subnetting to

   "supernetting" multiple Class C networks, deploying classless routing
   protocols, and generally deprecating the concept of "network address
   classes".  Each network address would be represented by a "pair": an
   address and a mask.  This proposal reserved the address 0.0.0.0 with
   mask 0.0.0.0 as the "default route" with special rules.  This was
   adopted in 1993 as Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) for Class C,
   and half of Class A (a quarter of the entire Internet address space)
   was reserved for future subnetting after deployment of more capable
   routing protocols.  [RFC1466], [RFC1518], [RFC1519]

   By 1995, the implementation of subnetting for "Class A" addresses
   proved sufficiently buggy that the IANA began a global experiment by
   allocating 256 subnetted Class A addresses to _every_ existing
   address space user, and encouraging them to be used to verify correct
   operation of their gateways and hosts, in [RFC1797].  Even in 1996,
   [RFC2036] described that large parts of the Internet could not
   correctly subnet Class A addresses.

   The remaining 1/16th of the "EXPERIMENTAL" portion of the address
   space has remained reserved and unused in the 38 years since 1981.
   [RFC1054]#4 This portion is now called 240/4 in CIDR notation.

   1/256th of the address space initially reserved for protocol
   functions was "network 0".  The address 0.0.0.0 was reserved for use
   only as a source address by nodes that do not know their own address
   yet.  [RFC1122](#3.2.1.3) Addresses of the form 0.x.y.z were
   initially defined only as a source address for "node number x.y.z on
   THIS NETWORK" by nodes that know their address on their local
   network, but do not yet know their network prefix.
   [RFC1122](#3.2.1.3) This definition was later repealed because the
   expected mechanism for learning their network prefix had turned out
   to be unworkable.  FIXME: [RFC0903], [RFC0951] ??  That repeal left
   16 million addresses reserved for future use.

   The other 1/256th of the address space initially reserved for
   protocol functions was network 127.  The entire set of 16 million
   addresses of the form 127.x.y.z were reserved in [RFC1122](#3.2.1.3)
   for "internal host loopback addresses" and "should never appear as a
   source or destination address on a network outside of a single node".
   When IPv6 was designed in the 1990s, this was seen as excessive, and
   in [RFC1884] the single IPv6 loopback address was defined.  But in
   IPv4, this reservation has continued to the present day.

   In 2011, IPv4 address exhaustion happened, on schedule.  Demand for
   IPv4 and IPv6 to IPv4 translation technologies spiked, leveraging
   [RFC1918], with [RFC7289] CGNs, [RFC6333] DS-Lite, and [RFC6877]
   464XLAT becoming widely adopted.  While each of these solutions is

   inadequate in their own way, and pure IPv6 is superior, the need for
   IPv4 address space appears unslakeable for the next 20 years.

   Although a market has appeared for existing IPv4 allocations, and
   small amounts of address space returned to the global pools, demand
   for IPv4 addressing continues unabated.  New edge and data center
   technologies are creating new demands, and internet-accessible
   servers will need to be dual stacked for a long time to come.

   In 2008 [I-D.fuller-240space], and 2010 [I-D.wilson-class-e] first
   proposed that the 240/4 address space become usable - the first draft
   mandating no explicit use; the second, as "private" RFC1918-like
   addresses.  Neither of these drafts became Internet Standards, yet
   the network community generally implemented them in major operating
   systems anyway.  Few people have noticed, since there was and still
   is no straightforward way to have such an IPv4 address block globally
   allocated for your network.

   Treating 240/4 as routable unicast is now a de facto standard, with
   support in all the major operating systems except Windows, and only a
   few edge cases left to fix.

   This Internet-Draft proposes that all implementers should make the
   small changes required to receive, transmit, and forward packets that
   contain addresses in this block as if they were within any other
   unicast address block.

   It is envisioned that the utility of this block will grow over time.
   Some devices may never be able to use it as their IP implementations
   have no update mechanism.

   Users are encouraged to treat 240/4 IPv4 allocations as a chance to
   improve IPv4 handling generally, to allow for more protocols than
   just UDP NAT and TCP to traverse it (such as UDP-Lite) and to address
   other long standing problems in the IPv4 blocks in new allocations
   such as using /32 rather than /30 networks.  FIXME what is this
   talking about?

3.  Unicast use of address space formerly reserved for future use

   The attributes of blocks of address space are described by the IANA
   and in IETF publications by structured, boxed tables; see [RFC6890].
   This document proposes replacing the former description tables of
   these blocks, with those included in this document.

   The broadcast address, 255.255.255.255, still must be treated
   specially: it is invalid as a source IP address, and it is invalid as
   a network interface address.  When used as the destination in a
   datagram sent by a node, it causes the packet to be broadcast on one
   of the hardware networks directly accessible to the node.  This
   behavior is unchanged from previously specified behavior in
   [RFC6890], table 16, e.g.:

3.2.  Unicast use of 0/8

   These new Unicast addresses, 0.0.0.1 thru 0.255.255.255, replace the

   The Unknown Local Address, 0.0.0.0, still must be treated specially:
   it is usable only as a source IP address, and only in nodes that do
   not know or have an IPv4 address on the network where the packet
   appears; it is invalid as a network interface address.  Typically,
   such an address is used when using a UDP-based protocol like BOOTP or
   DHCP to ask another node to supply this node with a usable address.
   This behavior is unchanged from previously specified behavior.

   The Loopback Addresses, 127.0.0.0 through 127.0.255.255, still must
   be treated specially: they are usable only as a destination IP
   address; they are invalid as a network interface address; and when
   used as a destination address in a packet, the packet is received and
   consumed only by the current node.  Typically, such an address is
   used when communicating with another process on this particular node.
   Multiple addresses are provided, and can be distinguished by
   recipient processes, to accommodate historical use patterns.  This
   behavior is unchanged from previously specified behavior, though it
   now only applies to 65,536 addresses rather than to 16,777,216
   addresses.

8.  Implementation status

   As of the release of the first version of this draft, Apple OSX and
   Apple IOS have been confirmed to support the use of 240.0.0.0/4 as
   unicast, globally reachable address space.  Solaris, Linux, Android,
   and FreeBSD all treat it as such.  These operating systems have
   supported 240/4 since 2008.  Four out of the top 5 open source IoT

   stacks, also treat 240/4 as unicast, with a 3 line patch awaiting
   submission for the last.  The [RFC6126] Babel routing protocol fully
   supports 240/4, and patches have been submitted to the BGP/OSPF/ISIS/
   etc capable routing daemon projects, "Bird", and "FRR".

   No plans have been announced for modifications to any version of
   Microsoft Windows, however Windows developers are aware of the work
   required and are considering it for a future version.

9.  Implementation guidelines

   LITTLE OF WHAT FOLLOWS BELONGS IN PROTOCOL REVISION INTERNET-DRAFT.

   The following guidelines have been developed via [IPv4CLEANUP]
   project.

9.1.  Allow configuration

   In Linux - patches were accepted into Linux 4.20 and backported into
   OpenWrt to allow for the assignment of 240/4 addresses via the
   otherwise obsolete ifconfig ioctl.  Support for assignment and static
   routing via netlink-enabled interfaces had otherwise been universally
   enabled since 2010.

   In FreeBSD - an incorrect ICMP check existed.

   All the open source ARP, DHCP, and DNS implementations do no explicit
   checking for 240/4 and thus "just work".  No open source application
   we have scanned has any limitations regarding usage of these
   addresses.

9.2.  Repair IN_MULTICAST and limit IN_EXPERIMENTAL macros

   One stack conflated an IN_MULTICAST check with the 240/4 address
   space.  e.g.

#define IN_MULTICAST(addr) (((addr & ntohl(0xfe000000)) == ntohl(0xfe000000)))

   where a correct check is:

#define IN_MULTICAST(addr) (((addr & ntohl(0xff000000)) == ntohl(0xfe000000)))

   Very few stacks actually check explicitly for the presence of 240/4
   addresses otherwise.  However as a macro that is extended to
   userspace, some binary applications may have trouble reaching 240/4
   until recompiled.

Internet-Draft                240-v4uniext                 February 2019


   The almost entirely unused IN_EXPERIMENTAL macro also has been
   revised to check for 255.255.255.255 only as a backwards compatible
   mechanism.

   Other network stacks and applications bury these checks deep in their
   libraries, however, searches for a key phrase of multicast usually
   turns up whatever code nearby that might need to be patched to fix
   it.

9.3.  Remove 240/4 from Martian Addresses and Bogon Lists

   [RFC2827] recommends that ISPs police their customers' traffic by
   dropping traffic entering their networks that is coming from a source
   address not legitimately in use by the customer network.  The
   filtering includes but is in no way limited to the traffic whose
   source address is a so-called "Martian Address" - an address that is
   reserved [3], including any address within 0.0.0.0/8, 10.0.0.0/8,
   127.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16, 224.0.0.0/4, or
   240.0.0.0/4.

   This memo removes 240.0.0.0/4 from the martian address spaces,
   keeping the universal broadcast address 255.255.255.255/32.  Bogon
   and martian lists that currently reduce 224/4 and 240/4 to 224/3 MUST
   be altered to block 224/4 and 255.255.255.255/32 only.

   Firewalls [CBR03], packet filters, and intrusion detection systems,
   MUST be upgraded to be capable of monitoring and managing these
   addresses.

   Routing protocols MUST treat these as unicast, globally routable
   addresses.

9.4.  Enable Reverse DNS for 255.0.0.0/8

   Common deployments of the BIND routing daemon (e.g.  Debian) map
   reverse DNS for 255. to a local empty domain and do not forward
   requests for that to in-addr.arpa.  The daemon itself does not have
   such a limit, with modern versions correctly intercepting
   255.255.255.255 only.

10.  Related Work

   The last attempts at making more IPv4 address space occurred in the
   2008-2010 timeframe, with proposals for making it pure public
   routable unicast [I-D.fuller-240space], or routable, but private,
   RFC1918 style address space [I-D.wilson-class-e].  Neither proposal
   gained traction in the IETF, however the first step - making 240/4
   actually work - was almost universally adopted in the field.

   It is presently unknown if any organization is making use of 240/4.

11.  IANA Considerations

   FIXME.  IANA is directed to make the 240/4 address space available as
   reverse DNS space in in-addr.arpa.

12.  Security Considerations

   Presently access to the 240/4 block is mostly assumed to be managed
   somewhere along the edge of the network, and wider availability
   merely requires removal of this space from common bogon lists and
   hard coded martian files.  In many other cases it will "just work",
   but thought needs to be given to any additional security exposures to
   existing firewalled networks.
