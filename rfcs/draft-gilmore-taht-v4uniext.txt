                        IPv4 Unicast Extensions
                     draft-gilmore-taht-v4uniext-01

Abstract

   The set of unicast addresses is the largest and most useful block of
   addresses in the Internet Protocol (IP).  Some portions of the IP
   address space have been "reserved for future use" for decades.  The
   future has arrived.

   This memo updates [RFC6890], reclassifying multiple underused address
   blocks as globally routable unicast address space.

2.  A short history of the Internet Addressing models

   The Internet Protocol version 4 addressing model started off simple
   and has evolved over 40 years.  This Internet-Draft briefly
   summarizes that evolution, and proposes that as IPv4 approaches the
   end of its design life, significant benefits to the Internet
   community can ensue from simplifying a few of the vestigial choices
   made during that evolution.

   The Internet Protocol (IP version 4, IPv4) was designed from scratch
   as a replacement for the ARPANET [RFC6529] protocols.  Rather than
   enforcing uniformity, it followed the "Catenet Model" [IEN48] of a
   concatenated network of diversely implemented underlying networks,
   connected by simple and relatively memoryless gateways.

2.1.  ARPANET -> IPv4

   The IP address, then expressed in x.x.x.x notation, could be used to
   specify both a particular network and a Host address on that network.
   There were several different classes of IP address, each having
   different numbers of bits allocated for the network # and address
   within that network.  Class A networks used 8 bits for network # and
   allowed 24 bits for address-on-that-network.  The ARPANET addresses
   could be encoded into 24 bits.  So, for ARPANET (and some of its
   clones), an IP address like 10.2.0.5 would mean network #10, Host #2
   on IMP #5.  Host #2 identified a specific physical connector on the
   back of the IMP cabinet.

   Routers (then known as gateways), hosts, and anybody else could take
   an IP address, and figure out the network address on that particular
   network by simple algorithm.  This worked for ARPANET, SATNET, and
   PRNETs.

   LANs broke this scheme.  In particular, Ethernet addresses were too
   big to be stuffed into even the 24 bits of a class-A IP address.  So
   algorithmic translations were not possible with those types of
   networks.  That ultimately led to the creation of ARP, and the use of
   broadcast capabilities of Ethernets, to implement a mechanism for
   doing translations.

   By the year 1981, IPv4 had landed as a simple and well-edited
   specification in [RFC0791], [RFC0792].

   The designers improved on ARPANET's addressing [RFC0635], and the
   addressing of several other common networks, with IPv4's 32-bit
   address space in [RFC0760].  The 32-bit address space was clearly
   chosen as a compromise; its inability to address all the nodes that
   would likely want to use it was known from the start, but resource

   limitations in early routers discouraged the use of longer addresses,
   and the IPv4 Internet was considered experimental and temporary.

   The initial IPv4 design designated almost 7/8ths of the possible
   addresses as Unicast addresses.  These addresses identified
   individual nodes and routers, and could be used as source and
   destination addresses of packets designed to be forwarded with full
   global reachability, and/or for packets on local area networks.
   [RFC0791][RFC0796] The term "unicast" only came into use when
   multicast was invented for the Internet protocol in 1985.  Initially
   ALL the existing non-reserved IP addresses were, by default, unicast
   addresses in [RFC0966].

   1/8th of the 32-bit address space was left as "reserved for future
   use", and a few other 256ths were reserved for simple protocol
   functions or for future use in [RFC0791] (section 3.2) and [RFC0796].

   1/256th of the address space initially reserved for protocol
   functions was "network 0". "0" was originally an ARPAnet network
   address for control messages.  The IPv4 address 0.0.0.0 was reserved
   for use only as a source address by nodes that do not know their own
   address yet in [RFC1122] (section 3.2.1.3).  Addresses of the form
   0.x.y.z were initially defined only as a source address for "node
   number x.y.z on THIS NETWORK" by nodes that know their address on
   their local network, but do not yet know their network prefix in
   [RFC0972] (pg 19).  This requirement was later repealed in [RFC1122]
   (section 3.2.2.7) because the expected ICMP-based mechanism for
   learning the network prefix had turned out to be unworkable and had
   been replaced by reverse ARP [RFC0903], and BOOTP ([RFC0951]).  This
   change left 16 million addresses in 0.0.0.0/8 reserved for future
   use.

   The other 1/256th of the address space initially reserved for
   protocol functions was network 127.  The entire set of 16 million
   addresses of the form 127.x.y.z were reserved in [RFC1122](section
   3.2.1.3) for "internal host loopback addresses" and "should never
   appear as a source or destination address on a network outside of a
   single node".  When IPv6 was designed in the 1990s, this was seen as
   excessive.  In [RFC1884] the single IPv6 loopback address was
   defined, but in IPv4, this reservation has continued to the present
   day.

   The remaining 1/16th of the "EXPERIMENTAL" portion of the address
   space has remained reserved and unused [RFC1112] (section 4) in the
   38 years since 1981.  This portion is now called 240/4 in CIDR
   notation and contains 268,435,455 addresses.

2.2.  Subnetting and broadcast extensions

   In 1984, subnets were made part of the IP protocol by [RFC0917] and
   [RFC0922].

   Initially, subnets were only used "locally".  The global Internet
   routing infrastructure still only knew how to route to Class A, B,
   and C networks.  Local equipment in each such network could route
   locally to any local subnets, such as multiple Ethernets on a
   university campus.

   Also in 1984, broadcast addresses were added to IPv4 by [RFC0919],
   and [RFC0922].  This required reserving one IPv4 address within each
   and every network or subnet (the final address in that network or
   subnet, the "all-ones" host address).  The address 255.255.255.255
   was also reserved to make it easier to broadcast on "a local hardware
   network" without knowing the details of those networks.  This made
   broadcast a useful mechanism for discovering a node's own address on
   the network.

   The 1984 broadcast extension also reserved the initial (zero) address
   in each network or subnet, with [RFC0919] stating that "There is
   probably no reason for such addresses to appear anywhere", with a
   now-obsolete exception.  It also, apparently by coincidence,
   documented a human writing convention of designating a "network
   number" with the zero address, such as 36.0.0.0.  This convention has
   confused subsequent protocol users into thinking that the initial
   (zero) address in a network or subnet cannot be used as an ordinary
   unicast node address.

   Before those standards were finalized, one popular IPv4
   implementation, 4.2 BSD, used the zero node address for broadcast,
   rather than the all-ones node address.  When these mismatched
   implementations tried to interoperate on an Ethernet, it was easy to
   produce "broadcast storms" that would consume all available network
   bandwidth until manually stopped.  The offending implementation was
   upgraded in the subsequent 4.3 BSD release to meet the standards.
   The problem has not recurred for decades, but a remnant of the gaffe
   exists in the prohibition in [RFC1122] (section 3.2.2.7) on using the
   zero node address in a network or subnet.

2.3.  Multicast

   Later (1988) designers chose to allocate 1/16th of the total space
   (half of the formerly reserved space) for multicast use in [RFC1112].
   While multicast was a much better idea than the sole similar former
   option (broadcast), its use on anything besides local area networks
   has remained a tiny niche, in retrospect clearly not worth

   designating 1/16th of the entire address space for.  This address
   space is called 224/4 in Phil Karn's more modern CIDR [RFC4632]
   notation.

   By 1989, the revisions to the basic Internet Protocol suite required
   reading dozens and dozens of documents.  The basic requirements for
   Internet hosts and gateways were then consolidated into
   [RFC1022][RFC1023][RFC1024].

2.4.  CIDR and NAT

   By 1992, the original network addressing and routing architecture was
   straining at the seams.  The problems were "the lack of a network
   class of a size which is appropriate for mid-sized organization[s]",
   growth of routing tables beyond available capacities, and the
   "eventual exhaustion of the 32-bit IP address space" as documented in
   [RFC1338].  After a convincing extrapolation that Class-B space would
   be exhausted by mid-1994 [IETF-13], the ROAD working group was
   formed.

   Their proposed fixes involved an extension of subnetting to
   "supernetting" multiple Class C networks, deploying classless routing
   protocols, and generally deprecating the concept of "network address
   classes".  Each network address would be represented by a "pair": an
   address and a mask.  This proposal reserved the address 0.0.0.0 with
   mask 0.0.0.0 as the "default route" with special rules.  This was
   adopted in 1993 as Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) for Class C,
   and half of Class A (a quarter of the entire Internet address space)
   was reserved for future subnetting after deployment of more capable
   routing protocols by [RFC1466], [RFC1518], [RFC1519].

   In 1994, NAT [RFC1631] also appeared as an interim solution to
   address depletion.

   By 1995, the implementation of subnetting for "Class A" addresses
   proved sufficiently buggy that the IANA began a global experiment by
   allocating 256 subnetted Class A addresses to _every_ existing
   address space user, and encouraging them to be used to verify correct
   operation of their gateways and hosts, in [RFC1797].  Even in 1996,
   [RFC2036] described that large parts of the Internet could not
   correctly subnet Class A addresses.

2.5.  IPv6 address extension

   IPv6 was first standardized in 1995 [RFC1883], and refined by many
   successive RFCs, currently culminating in [RFC8200].  It has an 128
   bit address space.

2.6.  IPv4 Address exhaustion

   In 2011, IPv4 address exhaustion happened, on schedule.  Demand for
   IPv4 and IPv6 to IPv4 translation technologies spiked, leveraging
   [RFC1918], with CGNS ([RFC7289]), DS-Lite ([RFC6333]), and 464XLAT
   ([RFC6877]) becoming widely adopted.  While each of these solutions
   is inadequate in their own way, and pure IPv6 is superior, the need
   for IPv4 address space appears unslakeable for the next 20 years.

   Although a market has appeared for existing IPv4 allocations, and
   small amounts of address space returned to the global pools, demand
   for IPv4 addressing continues unabated.  New edge and data center
   technologies are creating new demands, and internet-accessible
   servers will need to be dual stacked for a long time to come.

   In 2008 [I-D.fuller-240space], and 2010 [I-D.wilson-class-e] first
   proposed that the 240/4 address space become usable - the first draft
   mandating no explicit use; the second, as "private" RFC1918-like
   addresses.  Neither of these drafts became Internet Standards, yet
   the network community generally implemented them in major operating
   systems anyway.  Few people have noticed, since there was and still
   is no straightforward way to have such an IPv4 address block globally
   allocated for your network.

   Treating 240/4 as routable unicast is now a de facto standard, with
   support in all the major operating systems except Windows, and only a
   few edge cases left to fix.

   240/4 and the additional address blocks outlined in this memo can
   become viable unicast address blocks.

   This Internet-Draft proposes that all implementers should make the
   small changes required to receive, transmit, and forward packets that
   contain addresses in these blocks as if they were within any other
   unicast address block.

   It is envisioned that the utility of these blocks will grow over
   time.  Some devices may never be able to use them as their IP
   implementations have no update mechanism.

3.  Unicast use of address space formerly reserved for future use

   The attributes of blocks of address space are described by the IANA
   and in IETF publications by structured, boxed tables; see [RFC6890].
   This document proposes replacing the former description tables of
   these blocks, with those included in this document.

   The broadcast address, 255.255.255.255, still must be treated
   specially: it is invalid as a source IP address, and it is invalid as
   a network interface address.  When used as the destination in a
   datagram sent by a node, it causes the packet to be broadcast on one
   of the hardware networks directly accessible to the node.  This
   behavior is unchanged from previously specified behavior in
   [RFC6890], table 16, e.g.:

   The Unknown Local Address, 0.0.0.0, still must be treated specially:
   it is usable only as a source IP address, and only in nodes that do
   not know or have an IPv4 address on the network where the packet
   appears; it is invalid as a network interface address.  Typically,
   such an address is used when using a UDP-based protocol like BOOTP,
   DHCP, or IGMP [RFC4541] to ask another node to supply this node with
   a usable address.  This behavior is unchanged from previously
   specified behavior.

   The principal Multicast Addresses, 224.0.0.0 through 224.255.255.255,
   still must be treated specially.  They are only usable as a
   destination address; they are invalid as a network interface address;
   and when used as a destination address in a packet, the packet is
   sent to zero or more attached networks by using lower level network
   multicast capabilities that allow it to be received by multiple nodes
   on those networks.

   Multiple addresses are provided, and can be distinguished by
   recipient processes, to accommodate historical use patterns.  This
   behavior is unchanged from previously specified behavior, though it
   now only applies to 150,994,944 addresses rather than to 268,435,456

6.  Issues

   This document does not presently go into all the possible issues with
   these reallocations.  Prior documents conflate the end-purpose of
   these IP addresses without mandating the simple requirement that they
   be unicast and routable.

6.1.  Long Deployment Tail

   With sufficient thrust, [RFC1925], pigs can fly.

6.2.  Interoperation with un-extended nodes

   In nearly all cases a node without support for these address spaces,
   will simply fail to assign, forward, or reach them.

   Some potential for incorrect operation exists with the multicast
   space re-allocation.

6.3.  Martians lists, bogons and BCP38

   [RFC3704] states:

      [RFC2827] recommends that ISPs police their customers' traffic by
      dropping traffic entering their networks that is coming from a
      source address not legitimately in use by the customer network.
      The filtering includes but is in no way limited to the traffic
      whose source address is a so-called "Martian Address" - an address
      that is reserved [3], including any address within 0.0.0.0/8,
      10.0.0.0/8, 127.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16,
      224.0.0.0/4, or 240.0.0.0/4.

   This memo removes 0.0.0.0/8, 240.0.0.0/4, 127.0.0.0/8, and
   225.0.0.0/8-231.0.0.0/8 from the martian address spaces.

   Martian addresses will now include:

   o  0.0.0.0/32

   o  100.64.0.0/10

   o  10.0.0.0/8

   o  127.0.0.0/16

   o  172.16.0.0/12

   o  169.254.0.0/16

Internet-Draft                v4unicast-ext                February 2019


   o  192.0.0.0/24

   o  192.0.2.0/24

   o  192.168.0.0/16

   o  198.18.0.0/15

   o  198.51.100.0/24

   o  203.0.113.0/24

   o  224.0.0.0/8

   o  232.0.0.0/5

   o  255.255.255.255/32

   Firewalls [CBR03], packet filters, and intrusion detection systems,
   MUST be upgraded to be capable of monitoring and managing these
   addresses.

   Routing protocols MUST treat these as unicast, globally routable
   addresses.

6.4.  Enable Reverse DNS for 255.0.0.0/8

   Common deployments of the BIND routing daemon (e.g.  Debian) map
   reverse DNS for 255. to a local empty domain and do not forward
   requests for that to in-addr.arpa.  The daemon itself does not have
   such a limit, with modern versions correctly intercepting
   255.255.255.255 only.

7.  Implementation status

   As of the release of the first version of this draft, Apple OSX and
   Apple IOS have been confirmed to support the use of 240.0.0.0/4 as
   unicast, globally reachable address space.  Solaris, Linux, Android,
   and FreeBSD all treat it as such, also.  These operating systems have
   supported 240/4 since 2008.  Four out of the top 5 open source IoT
   stacks, also treat 240/4 as unicast, with a 3 line patch awaiting
   submission for the last.  The [RFC6126] Babel routing protocol fully
   supports 240/4, and patches have been submitted to the BGP/OSPF/ISIS
   capable routing daemon projects, "Bird", and "FRR".

   No plans have been announced for modifications to any version of
   Microsoft Windows, however Windows developers are aware of the work
   required and are considering it for a future version.

   Patches are available for Linux for the other address spaces.

8.  Related Work

   The last attempts at making more IPv4 address space occurred in the
   2008-2010 timeframe, with proposals for making it pure public
   routable unicast [I-D.fuller-240space], or routable, but private,
   RFC1918 style address space [I-D.wilson-class-e].  Neither proposal
   gained traction in the IETF, however the first step - making 240/4
   actually work - was almost universally adopted in the field.

   It is presently unknown if any organization is making use of 240/4,
   0/8, or any of the reserved portions of multicast now re-assigned to
   unicast.  A network periscope study is planned.

9.  IANA Considerations

   Although this memo requires implementations to treat these addresses
   the same as any other unicast addresses, it does not change the
   "reserved" status of any block.  The IANA is requested to mark these
   new blocks as unallocated, with the understanding that future
   standards action will define how they are to be allocated.

   240.0.0.0/4 and 0.0.0.0/8 move from the "special purpose" registry
   (https://www.iana.org/assignments/iana-ipv4-special-registry/iana-
   ipv4-special-registry.xhtml [1]) and are added to the regular "ipv4-
   address-space" registry ( https://www.iana.org/assignments/ipv4-
   address-space/ipv4-address-space.xhtml) [2]

   0.0.0.0/32 and 127.0.0.0/16 should be added to the special purpose
   registry.

   In the ipv4-address-space registry, 240/4 should be moved from future
   use to unallocated, and 225/8 - 231/8 should be moved from multicast
   to unallocated. 127.1.0.0/16 and up should be added.

   IANA is directed also to prepare the these address spaces to be
   available as reverse DNS space in in-addr.arpa.

10.  Security Considerations

   Presently access to the 240/4 and 0/8 blocks are mostly assumed to be
   managed somewhere along the edge of the network, and wider
   availability merely requires removal of this space from common bogon
   lists and hard coded martian files.  In many other cases it will
   "just work", but thought needs to be given to any additional security
   exposures to existing firewalled networks.

   Address space in the localnet and multicast blocks are also primarily
   assumed to be managed elsewhere in the network, and subject to the
   same bogon filter and martian list fixes, however it seems likely
   that 127 in particular, having been "localnet" so long, is on fewer
   bogon/martian lists than it should.
