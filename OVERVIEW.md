* 1972 Arpanet rolled out
* 1981 TCP/IP rolled out
* 1992 CIDR developed
The original IPv4 address space was a 32 bit "address extension" to the arpanet
address space, which only supported 256 nodes. We carved up the world into into class A, class B, class C, class D (multicast), and class E (reserved).

It seemed an eminently good division at the time. By 1989, however, it was
obvious that these divisions were straining at the seams, and CIDR was developed
to fix it.


* 1994 IPv6 started
* 2012 IPv6 rollout started
